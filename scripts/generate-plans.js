// Generator removed — this project now ships pre-generated plans in data/
// If you need to regenerate plans, re-create a generator that has a source of book
// chapter counts. The previous generator used `data/books.json`, which has been removed
// per project cleanup. Leaving this stub in place so `npm` or tooling that expects
// the script won't error if invoked accidentally.
